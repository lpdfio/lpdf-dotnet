/// <summary>Draws shapes at exact positions on the page, independent of the flowing layout: watermarks, stamps, page furniture. Coordinates start at the top left corner of the whole page, not inside the layout's margin, and y grows downward. A layer before the section's layout paints under it, and one after paints over it. It sets what applies to all of its shapes: which pages they appear on, opacity, transform and clip. Layers cannot be nested.</summary>
