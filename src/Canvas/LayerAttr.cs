/// <summary>Draws shapes, text, images and barcodes at exact positions on the page, independent of the flowing layout: watermarks, stamps, page furniture. Coordinates start at the top left corner of the whole page, not inside the layout's margin, and y grows downward. A layer before the section's layout paints under it, and one after paints over it. It sets what applies to all of its content: which pages it appears on, opacity, transform and clip, and the font, size and color of its text. Layers cannot be nested.</summary>

The element keeps its room either way, so nothing moves. An element with a group inside an element with another shows only where both show. Acrobat, Chrome and Firefox switch the groups; Preview and Safari show everything, on screen and in print. Hidden content is still in the file, where it can be selected and copied: it is not a way to keep anything secret. A link in print content is drawn and does nothing, and a form field can't be in print content: use a frame with a border for a box filled in by hand. With pdfa, pdfua or pdfx on the output, everything shows.</summary>
