It is one line unless told otherwise; give width to cut it off at a width or to wrap it with max-lines. x and y place its box: the top-left corner, or with anchor, an offset from that point of the page, where the box's matching point goes. {page} and {pages} in it count within the section, and a text that comes from data belongs in the layout, since a longer text loses its end here without a warning.</summary>
