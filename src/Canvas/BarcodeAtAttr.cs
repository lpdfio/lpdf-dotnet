Acrobat, Chrome and Firefox switch the groups; Preview and Safari show everything, on screen and in print. Hidden content is still in the file, where it can be selected and copied: it is not a way to keep anything secret. A link in print content is drawn and does nothing, and a form field can't be in print content: use a frame with a border for a box filled in by hand. With pdfa or pdfua on the output, everything shows. With pdfx, the file is the print version: screen content stays in it, off, and a reader can turn it on in a layers panel.</summary>
