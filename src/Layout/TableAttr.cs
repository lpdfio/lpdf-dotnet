A number with no unit is a share, so 2 1 is 2fr 1fr; any other width is an error. An auto column takes the width its cells need on one line, and the auto columns share what the fixed columns (pt, mm, in and %) leave, in proportion to what they need. When they do not fit, each keeps at least its longest word, and when not even those fit, the longest are cut and a short column keeps its width. auto and fr cannot be in one table: use a length or % for the fixed columns. For example auto 90pt 60pt.</summary>

The pages are the ones the same table would have without bulk. The rows follow rules, and so do the thead and the other rows: each td holds one text or none, a text holds plain words with no span, link, bookmark, footnote or reference, and sets no widows or orphans, a text without max-lines holds one line and ends in an ellipsis, a td has no rowspan, a row no keep, and nothing in a row has data-source. A row never splits across pages. The table sits directly in the layout, has no data-source of its own and one tr with it, sets its cols in fr, pt, mm, in or %, has no height, and neither it nor anything in it has paginate. Its document has no table of contents, no reference to a bookmark, no pdfua and no pdfa of level a, and its section's columns are not balanced. Breaking a rule is an error that names it. Default false.</summary>

The element keeps its room either way, so nothing moves. An element with a group inside an element with another shows only where both show. Acrobat, Chrome and Firefox switch the groups; Preview and Safari show everything, on screen and in print. Hidden content is still in the file, where it can be selected and copied: it is not a way to keep anything secret. A link in print content is drawn and does nothing, and a form field can't be in print content: use a frame with a border for a box filled in by hand. With pdfa or pdfua on the output, everything shows. With pdfx, the file is the print version: screen content stays in it, off, and a reader can turn it on in a layers panel.</summary>
