/// <summary>Code, or any text whose spaces and lines matter, in a box. The text is kept as it is written: every space, and a new line wherever one is written, except the line break after the start tag and the indent of the line the end tag stands on. A line longer than the box wraps at a space, and a word with none breaks at the last character that fits, so nothing is cut off. A tab fills to the next multiple of tab-size columns. The box fills the width and grows with its lines, in Courier on a light tint with padding m unless font, background and padding say otherwise. It holds text and span children, which color or style parts of it. It splits across pages between lines, and each part is drawn in its own box. A code element is a column around one text, so the text takes its font, size and color from font, font-size and color.</summary>

    /// <summary>Space between the edge of the box and its content, written like CSS: one value for all sides, two for top-bottom and left-right, three for top, left-right and bottom, four for top, right, bottom and left.

    /// <summary>Height of the box. Leave it out to size to the content.

An opacity from 0 to 1 after the color fades the shadow alone: "2pt 3pt #000000 0.2". There is no blur. The shadow takes no room in the layout, so it can run into the margin or a neighbor, and the siblings after the box are drawn over it. A box with no background shows the shadow only outside it.
