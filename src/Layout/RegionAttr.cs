/// <summary>Pins content to the top or bottom edge of pages, outside the normal flow, for headers and footers. It reserves that space on every page it appears on. Only allowed directly inside layout. Where it is written among the flow does not matter: pin chooses the edge, and regions on one edge stack in the order written. With pin set to inset, it is a block at a spot inside the section's columns instead, such as a picture or a box across two columns of a newsletter: top and height place it, col and colspan say which columns it covers, and those columns flow around it, filling above it and carrying on below it.</summary>
