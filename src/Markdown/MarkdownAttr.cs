/// <summary>Markdown as the content of a section, where a layout would go. It holds only Markdown: optional markdown-styles, which say how each part of it looks, and one markdown-content, which holds the text. The page, a header, a footer or a cover are not Markdown, so they stay in the XML: layers paint a header and a footer in the margin, and a cover or a table of contents is a section of its own. CommonMark with tables, strikethrough and footnotes, and a $ is text. Raw HTML is for an HTML output, which a PDF is not, so a tag is left out and the words in it are kept: a block such as a p or a div puts the words around it on lines of their own. Two tags are read: br breaks a line, and img shows an image, at its width and height in pixels when it has them, which Markdown's own image has no way to say. An image at a URL, in Markdown or in an img, is left out, since an image must be an asset. A heading is a bookmark, so the table of contents and the outline of the viewer fill themselves.</summary>
