/// <summary>How the parts of the Markdown look. A rule is named after the Markdown it styles and takes the attributes of the element it becomes, so that h1 takes what a text takes. A rule here overrides the same rule of the file that src names, which overrides the defaults: a style that is not set stays what it was. Values are the tokens' (font-size="xxl", color="primary") or plain lengths and colors, and fonts are names from assets. A built-in font needs no rule for italic and bold; an embedded font names the faces: em font="body-italic", strong font="body-bold".</summary>
